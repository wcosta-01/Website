							<p>My first experience with UX/UI design was when I was the only one who applied for an internship in the summer of 2021. Where I was tasked with re-designing the <a href="https://www.seedways.org/">Seedways.org</a> E-commerce site. With little to no experience with building or designing a website, I was a little out of my comfort zone. They were already using Wix to design and publish their website so I just found a template that looked similar to some of their competitors, and got to work adding images and text. At the time, I knew basically nothing about how the design process worked, basic workflows, and establishing communication with a client. In the end I thought it turned out pretty good. I will also be continuing to update and develop the page. 
								The fall semester of 2021, I decided to take a graphic design class to learn how designing apps and websites actually works. In the course we used an application called figma. It basically allowed designers to create a prototype of what the final product would and feel like. This program would have solved one of my problems during the internship. I sent my client a word document with boxes outlining a basic homepage design. So learning Figma was a huge help in the development department.</p>
							<p> While most of my experience was in the backend development of software, it was very interesting to see the frontend development. I have used figma outside of class to show case a simple app idea that I have had for a while now and finally took steps in developing it during my fall semester of my senior year.</p>
